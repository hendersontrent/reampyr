# ReamPyr
Builds a simple GUI application that uses machine learning to model/reamp a guitar amplifier signal.

## Motivation
Guitar amp modellers are so prominent today, and I am very curious as to how they work. Given my experience in machine learning and time series analysis, it seems fun to try a few algorithms to see how close to a processed signal they can get.

## End product
An interactive GUI that lets the user upload a raw Direct Input (DI) recorded signal from an electric guitar as well as a recorded signal from an amplifier they like. These inputs are used to train a neural network to model the amplified sound and turn the raw DI into a processed sound.
